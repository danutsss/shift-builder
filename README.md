# Shift Builder

## Brief
My challenge was to build a web application to track the employees' work hours. The purpose of the application is to provide a clear and simple solution for employees who need to submit their hourly report for their monthly salary.

## Main goals
- managing shifts in various jobs (workplaces);
- management of hours by workplace;
- generate reports and statistics to various filters;

## Architecture and Technological requirements
Integrate the web application (client only) without server side data.

- Infrastructures:
  - Client side:
    - HTML;
    - CSS (I used TailwindCSS);
    - JavaScript;
  - Database:
    - localStorage;
  - Internationalisation:
    - english;
  - Security:
    - localStorage;
    
### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like: `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the localStorage.
